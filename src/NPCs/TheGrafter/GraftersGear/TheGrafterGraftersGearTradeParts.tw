<p>The air is thick with the scent of lubricant and burnt ozone, mingling with the metallic tang of the cyberware that adorns every corner of Grafter's Gear. You slide a set of high-quality parts across the counter, your eyes locked with the Grafter's calculating gaze. The prospect of a beneficial trade hangs in the air, the potential to walk away with something far more valuable than what you offered.</p>

    <<case 1>> <!-- Lucrative Exchange -->
        <p>The Grafter is particularly interested in the parts you offer and throws in a little extra as a bonus. You walk away with more cyberware than expected and a small credit bump.</p>

        <<if $player.credits >= 50>> <!-- Player has enough credits to cover loss -->

        <<else>> <!-- Not enough credits, add to debt -->
            <p>The Grafter is firm on the cost, your current credits falling short. The surplus is logged onto your tab, and you're reminded that everything comes at a price.</p>
