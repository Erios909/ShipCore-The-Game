    <<case 1>> <!-- Fortunate Barter -->
        <p>As you sift through the piles of scrap metal and discarded gadgets, you spot some promising pieces that catch your eye. Picking them up, you examine them closely, turning them over in your hands as your experienced gaze identifies parts that could be useful. Clutching your finds, you make your way over to one of the scrap traders, an cyborg with a heavily scarred exoskeleton. 

"Let's make a deal," you say confidently, presenting the parts spread out on the table. The cyborg looks them over carefully. After some back and forth negotiation, you manage to trade the scrap for two premium servo motors in pristine condition, as well as a handful of credits for your trouble. The trader seems pleased with the exchange.

As you gather your new parts, you feel satisfied at having secured some valuable components for your ship. Your negotiating skills have paid off once again, allowing you to turn scrap into treasure here in the Electric Emporium.</p>

    <<case 2>> <!-- Abysmal Exchange Rate -->
        <p>The market is tough, and you're forced to make a trade that's less than favorable. You leave with some credits but feel like you could have gotten more.</p>

    <<case 4>> <!-- No Deal -->
        <p>No one is interested in what you have to offer. You spend the time getting to know the market better, but ultimately walk back with your scrap.</p>

    <<case 5>> <!-- Surplus Surprise -->
        <p>A surplus sell-off works in your favor. An opportunistic trader swaps your scrap for a few more advanced parts than usual.</p>

    <<case 6>> <!-- Unfair Exchange -->

        <<itemchange "scrap" 2 "loss">><br>

    <<case 7>> <!-- Generous Offer -->

    <<case 9>> <!-- Gadget Goldmine -->
        <p>You find a defunct gadget that contains rare parts. After some haggling, a tech enthusiast eagerly exchanges it for a useful sum of credits.</p>

    <<default>> <!-- Default Scrap Trading Event -->
        <p>Your trading efforts come to fruition. While not the best day on record, you secure an exchange of scrap for credits. It's clear no one really wants to trade anymore today, though. You might have better luck trying tomorrow.</p>
