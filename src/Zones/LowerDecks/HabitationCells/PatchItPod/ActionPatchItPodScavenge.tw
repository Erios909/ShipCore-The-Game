    <<case 1>> <!-- Hidden Gem Among the Scrap -->
        <p>Deep within a pile of scrap, your hand grazes something solid and unexpectedly pristine. It's a functioning data pad, perhaps discarded in haste or error. It could fetch a good price.</p>
        <<creditchange 30 "positive">>
        <<itemchange "scrap" 1 "gain">><br>

    <<case 2>> <!-- Old Relic with a Story -->
        <p>You find an old relic, a trinket with intricate engravings. To your surprise, an antique dealer in the pod recognizes its origin and offers to buy it on the spot.</p>
        <<creditchange 20 "positive">>
        <<itemchange "scrap" 1 "gain">><br>

    <<case 3>> <!-- Junkyard Hazard -->
        <p>What looks like a harmless pile of junk turns out to be a precarious stack. A wrong move sends metals clattering, and you barely dodge a sharp edge. It's a close call, and you're shaken but safe.</p>
        <<changemoods "stress" "minor" "PosEffectOnPlayer">><br>

    <<case 4>> <!-- The Engineer's Cache -->
        <p>Beneath a fa√ßade of broken appliances, you uncover a cache of valuable engineering components. These could be useful for your own repairs, or sold to those in need.</p>
        <<creditchange 25 "positive">>
        <<itemchange "scrap" 1 "gain">><br>

    <<case 5>> <!-- Eclectic Collector's Request -->
        <p>An eccentric collector at the pod admires your knack for finding the unusual. A quick deal is struck and you part with some oddities in exchange for credits.</p>
        <<creditchange 15 "positive">>
        <<itemchange "scrap" 1 "gain">><br>

    <<default>> <!-- Default Scavenging Event -->
        <p>Your search through the recyclers doesn't unearth anything of big value today, but the smaller components you find could prove useful later. It's not a wasted effort.</p>
